    "summary": "I served 12 years as a law enforcement officer, including management experience as a command staff level officer. My passion for technology extending beyond that as I've spent many years learning how to code and build software. I've worked on projects ranging from video game mods to web applications. I obtained an AAS in CIT - Programming from BCTC in 2022 as my passion for software grew and I became interested in switching careers. In early 2023, I began working part-time as a software developer alongside my law enforcement career. I made a decision to transition to full-time tech as a career in early 2024. As an already experienced developer, I've immediately contributed to many large projects at my company including being the lead developer on large-scale projects. I continue to grow and learn as a software developer as I'm always learning new programming languages and technologies as I broaden my skillset and keep up with new technologies as they evolve.",
